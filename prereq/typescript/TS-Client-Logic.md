### Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?

---

As we know, Solana on-chain data and smart contracts are written in Rust, and Rust is a type-safe language. So, to interact with those contracts from the client side in a safe manner, we use TypeScript because of its type safety. It provides a good developer experience by showing most errors during the development phase and minimizing the risk of failure in production.

I think this is the main reason why Solana prefers TypeScript for its client-side development.
